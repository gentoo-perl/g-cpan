Revision history for g-cpan

0.18.0 2022-07-03

  - Use EAPI 8 for generated ebuilds, rather than banned EAPI 5. This became
    particularly important as the Perl eclasses (perl-functions.eclass,
    perl-module.eclass) dropped EAPI 5 support. Thanks to
    Ian Pickworth <ian@pickworth.me.uk>.

  - Add 'make check' target for syntax checking.

0.17.0 2020-04-03

  - add Gentoo::Portage::Q module and migrate to it for get env vars, get repos, etc
    so should fix Gentoo bug #581490 and github #26

  - introduce App::gcpan and start slowly moving code from g-cpan to there

  - rework Makefile.PL a little
    - keep non-core & core deps separatly
    - place test reqs under proper section

  - migrate to 'Changes' (CPAN-like) instead of 'ChangeLog'
    but keep 'ChangeLog' anyway to save history
